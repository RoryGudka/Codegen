## Codebase Overview

This codebase provides a comprehensive framework for managing files and utilizing AI functionalities. The primary components include tools for file creation (`createFileTool.js`), editing (`editFileTool.js`), reading (`readFileTool.js`), and querying specific files with questions (`askFileQuestionTool.js`).

## Key Components:

1. **File Management Tools:**
   - **createFileTool.js:** Creates new files with specified content if they do not exist, ensuring safe file creation.
   - **editFileTool.js:** Edits existing files based on detailed instructions and context, facilitating file updates.
   - **readFileTool.js:** Reads and returns contents of specified files, handling file access tasks.

2. **AI Integration:**
   - **openai.js:** Initializes and configures the OpenAI client for AI services, supporting natural language processing and other AI-related tasks.
   - **init.js:** Sets up an assistant using OpenAI services for communication and context establishment within tasks.

3. **Context and Structure Management:**
   - **getContextFile.js:** Retrieves and returns content from the context file, informing about repository setup or application context.
   - **getFileStructure.js:** Generates file structure representation, respecting `.gitignore` rules for accurate directory overview.

These components work in tandem to support dynamic interactions, automated file management, and AI-driven functionalities throughout the codebase.
